;; Commands
;; =====================
;; select word
;; split prose into prose/code/prose
;; split code into code/prose/code
;;
;; Structure
;; =====================
;;
;; give each form a unique id;
;; allows for inserting forms into AST
;; without re-parsing the whole damn thing.
;;
;;
;;
;; Edits inside a form don't propagate upwards until one of:
;; - `eval`
;; - `blur`
;; (warning: sometimes you have 2 top-level forms just because
;;  you are in the middle of editing & want to slurp, etc.)
;;
;; Shortcuts allow quick jumping between code and comment block
